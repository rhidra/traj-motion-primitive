# UAV Motion Primitive Trajectory Generation

Implementation of a UAV motion primitive based trajectory generation framework.

The motion primitive generation is based on this paper: 
**Mueller, Hehn, "_A computationally efficient motion primitive for quadrocopter trajectory generation_"**
with the source code available [here](https://github.com/markwmuller/RapidQuadrocopterTrajectories).
